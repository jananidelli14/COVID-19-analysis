# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data using Python. Through various visualizations and statistical insights, the project aims to explore global trends, recovery and death rates, active cases, and region-wise comparisons to better understand the impact of the pandemic.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze the global spread and progression of COVID-19.
- Track trends in confirmed, cured (recovered), and death cases.
- Identify high-risk regions based on active and death cases.
- Compare recovery and death rates over time.
- Provide engaging visualizations to extract meaningful insights.

## 📊 Visualizations

This project includes:

- 📈 **Daily New Confirmed Cases** (Line chart)
- 📊 **Confirmed vs Recovered Cases** (Comparison Line Plot with shaded area)
- 🔥 **Top 10 States by Active Cases** (Bar Plot)
- ☠️ **Death Distribution - Top 5 States** (Pie Chart)
- 📉 **Recovery Rate vs Death Rate** (Line chart comparison)
- 📍 **Active Cases Over Time** (Enhanced Area Chart)
- 🧪 **Correlation Heatmap** (Confirmed vs Recovered vs Deaths)
- 📈 **Daily Growth Rate of Confirmed Cases**
- 📊 **Stacked Area Chart** (Active, Cured, Deaths)
- 🌍 **Animated Line Chart** (Confirmed, Deaths, Cured using Plotly)

## 📂 Dataset

- COVID-19 global dataset including:
  - Date-wise confirmed, cured, and death cases
  - State/region-level summaries
  - Derived metrics: active cases, growth rate, recovery & death rates

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- 📈 Confirmed cases showed sharp increases during pandemic peaks.
- ✅ Recovery rates improved over time due to better healthcare strategies.
- ☠️ Certain states contributed significantly to total death counts.
- 🦠 Active case tracking revealed clear wave patterns.
- 📉 Growth rate analysis helped detect when the virus spread slowed.
- 🧪 Correlation among confirmed, recovered, and deaths showed strong inter-dependencies.
